how do i get the commit messages in the console like if i actually typed the command
what if the commit isn't done running before I try to push because I have a bunch of node modules?
should I make an async function and attach and await to each of my function calls and then
run that one function?
maybe I should use child_process.execSync if I want it to run synchronously?

for authentication:
try to get their phone number thru git account information either in the terminal or using github's api
if not run git config --global user.email to get the email associated with the address, create a number either 
a static one or do a random one with math.Random() and use either twilio or an email api to email
that email address
make the program stop and have the user input that variable before it continues to run: if the input is incorrect
kill the program and don't make any commits if successful run the rest of the program

this is good because of the podcast I listened to about the xbox kids hacking the devs github
